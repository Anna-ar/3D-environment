## Description
The International Hellenic University of Sindos, created in a three dimensional model through the 3D graphics design program, Blender.
The purpose of creating this model was to integrate it into a driving simulation environment in order to test a virtual vehicle within I.H.U. An idea that appeared through the [DrAIve](https://draive.gr/) project and was assigned to [Anna-Ar](https://github.com/Anna-ar) and [Valentina-Ar](https://github.com/Valentina-ar) as a Thesis Project at **Information Technology and Electronic Systems Engineering Department of I.H.U.**
